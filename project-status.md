### Security

#### Dependency Vulnerabilities

Current vulnerabilities identified via `npm audit`:

- ~~**esbuild <=0.24.2**: Moderate severity - enables any website to send requests to the development server and read the response~~
- ~~**vite 0.11.0-6.1.4**: Depends on vulnerable versions of esbuild~~

**Action Plan:**
- ✅ Update Vite to the latest version (>= 6.1.5) to resolve esbuild vulnerability (Current: v6.2.5)
- [ ] Set up GitHub Dependabot for automated security alerts and dependency updates
- [ ] Implement a pre-commit hook to run security audits
- [ ] Schedule monthly dependency reviews

- ✅ Implemented mock authentication with automatic success in development mode
- ✅ Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all database tables
- ✅ Implemented role-based access control with roles table and admin policies
- ✅ Added role_id field to profiles table with default user role
- [ ] Add multi-factor authentication option (MFA logging infrastructure is in place)
- [ ] Create comprehensive security testing suite

#### Data Security & Privacy

### Blockers
- None currently identified

### Notes
- The application is now using a database-agnostic mock data layer instead of Supabase
- Mock data is provided for all entities (users, wardrobe items, outfits)
- Authentication flow is simulated with automatic success in development mode
- The architecture supports easy switching between mock data and real backend implementations

## Recent Changes

### Fully Clickable Mock UI Experience
- ✅ Added global design toggle with USE_MOCKS constant
- ✅ Bypassed authentication in AuthContext with mock user
- ✅ Auto-skipping login pages in routes when in design mode
- ✅ Created mock services for outfits and wardrobe items
- ✅ Added toast notifications for all user interactions
- ✅ Created DesignHub page for easy navigation to all pages
- ✅ Added Design Mode badge for clear indication of mock state
- ✅ Updated service factory to conditionally use mock or real services

This implementation allows for:
1. Complete UI/UX testing without backend dependencies
2. Seamless navigation between all app pages without authentication
3. Simulated interactions with toast notifications for feedback
4. Centralized navigation hub for designers and stakeholders
5. Easy toggling between mock and real data via environment variables

### Database Abstraction Layer
- ✅ Created database-agnostic data provider interface
- ✅ Implemented mock data provider with realistic test data
- ✅ Updated authentication service to use mock data
- ✅ Added environment configuration for toggling mock mode
- ✅ Created JSON mock data files for all entities

This approach allows for:
1. UI/UX development without backend dependencies
2. Easy switching between different backend implementations
3. Consistent data access patterns across the application
4. Future flexibility to integrate with any database solution
